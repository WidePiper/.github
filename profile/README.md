# WidePiper: Organization Overview

Welcome to the WidePiper organization repository! This repository hosts the various components of the WidePiper project, a blockchain-powered platform designed to facilitate the management of derivative assets and interaction with blockchain wallets and decentralized exchanges (DEX). Below you'll find an overview of the project's architecture, guidelines for contribution, and links to the specific repositories for each component.

## Project Structure

WidePiper consists of several interconnected systems, which can be broken down into the following core components:

### 1. Frontend

The frontend provides users with an intuitive interface for interacting with their wallets, viewing derivative assets, and managing transactions.

- **Key Features**: Portfolio management, user wallet interaction, transaction history display, and derivative management.

You can find more information and the codebase for the frontend here: [Frontend Repository](#).

### 2. Server (Backend)

The server is responsible for managing user data, connecting to the blockchain, handling requests from the frontend, and ensuring a smooth flow of operations for the derivative management mechanism.

- **Key Modules**: Wallet Management, Transaction Handling, Exchange Mechanism, Game Wallet Integration

For more information, please visit the backend repository: [Backend Repository](#).

### 3. Blockchain 

The blockchain layer is the core of the WidePiper ecosystem. It includes smart contracts for managing tokens, executing derivative transactions, managing liquidity, and interacting with decentralized exchanges.

- **Core Components**:
  - **Smart Contracts for Tokens**: Smart contracts for the Idea and Matter tokens, which are used for staking within the ecosystem.
  - **Smart Contract for Wallet Management**: A smart contract to manage user wallets within the application, enabling secure fund transfers and interaction with tokens.
  - **Derivative Management Contract**: A smart contract to facilitate the placing and execution of derivative transactions.
